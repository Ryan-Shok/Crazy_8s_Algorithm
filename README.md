# Crazy_8s_Algorithm
This is a Crazy 8s card game against a computer AI/algorithm that utilizes minimax in its decision-making process. Various possible moves have each of their detriments and benefits calculated through a point system which the computer then uses to evaluate the most beneficial card combination for the turn.

Basically you just need to click on the cards in your hand to play them (Match the Suit or Number with that of the Floor Card).
If you can play a combo, the game will let you choose multiple cards in your hand to all be placed at once (Matching Numbers for Combo).
Special Card rules appear in game.

NOTE: You will need a JDK on your computer to import - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ under File, Project Structure, SDK

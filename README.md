# Crazy_8s_Algorithm
This is a Crazy 8s card game against a computer AI/algorithm that utilizes minimax in its decision-making process. 
Basically you just need to click on the cards in your hand to play them (Match the Suit or Number with that of the Floor Card).
If you can play a combo, the game will let you choose multiple cards in your hand to all be placed at once (Matching Numbers for Combo).
Special Card rules appear in game.
